This repo contains lecture-notes for the Computer Networking half of CSD 322. The notes are an abridged version of the slides presented in class and cover the material you should study for the final exam.

## How To Access
Here are some options to access the notes:

1. Use the website http://vishesh-khemani.github.io/2025-winter-csd322/networking
   
    This is the easiest option. But the website has some formatting issues. For example it does not render math formatting properly. 

2. Clone the github repo https://github.com/vishesh-khemani/2025-winter-csd322.git (or directly download the "networking" folder from the repo).
   
   1. You can then access the source text (markdown) directly in an IDE of your choice (I use Visual Studio Code).
      1. You can modify the source text with your own notes in your local copy.
      2. You can preview a rendered version of the markdown if your IDE supports that (VSCode has a rather nice preview).
   2. Another option is to use a tool (e.g. pandoc) to convert the markdown to html/pdf and view with a viewer of your choice.
